Creating an AI system that generates an expected question paper based on uploaded previous years' question papers involves several steps. Here's a simplified outline of the process:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a large dataset of previous years' question papers in a digital format. Ensure that the dataset covers a diverse range of topics and difficulty levels.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and organize the data. Convert the question papers into a machine-readable format, and extract relevant information such as questions, topics, and their corresponding solutions.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Identify key features from the questions and solutions that can help the AI understand the structure, difficulty, and topic of each question. This might include natural language processing techniques.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose a suitable machine learning or deep learning model. Given the nature of the task (generating questions), a sequence-to-sequence model or a language model like GPT-3 could be considered.

5. **Training:**
   - Train the selected model using the preprocessed data. This involves adjusting the model's parameters to learn patterns and relationships within the dataset.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess the performance of the model using a validation set. This step helps ensure that the generated questions are relevant, diverse, and align with the difficulty levels of the input data.

7. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for users to upload previous years' question papers and receive the generated expected question paper. This could be a web application or a standalone software.

8. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Implement a feedback mechanism so that users can provide feedback on the generated questions. This information can be used to continuously improve and refine the AI model.

9. **Fine-tuning:**
   - Periodically update and fine-tune the model using the feedback received from users. This helps the model adapt to new trends and requirements in question paper generation.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the system for public use, ensuring that it can handle multiple users simultaneously and maintain the security and privacy of the uploaded data.

It's important to note that developing such a system requires expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. Additionally, ethical considerations and potential misuse of the system should be carefully addressed during the development process.
